# STM32F072RBT6 Custom Bootloader üöÄ

## Overview
This project implements a **custom bootloader** for the STM32F072RBT6, enabling dynamic selection between multiple firmware images stored in flash. The bootloader accepts inputs (**1,2,3,4**) from UART RX (tested with Minicom) to load the corresponding firmware. If the **user button** is not pressed on reset, the bootloader skips execution, and the default firmware (which blinks **LD3**) runs automatically.

## Features
- ‚úÖ **Multi-application support** (Bootloader selects firmware based on user button conditions on reset)
- ‚úÖ **Interrupt handling via Bootloader's Vector Table**
- ‚úÖ **Efficient UART communication (without hardware flow control issues)**
- ‚úÖ **Function pointer-based API for shared services**
- ‚úÖ **Accurate Delay generated by SysTick timer**


## Challenges Faced & Solutions
### 1Ô∏è‚É£ **Handling Interrupts Without VTOR (Cortex-M0 Limitation)**
**Problem:** Cortex-M0 lacks the **Vector Table Offset Register (VTOR)**, making it difficult to relocate the vector table for different firmware images.

‚úÖ **Solution:** There are 2 ways to solve this either copy each firmwares vector table to SRAM or use bootloader vector table. Since this is a simple applciation i went with using the bootlaoders vector table as it was giving a stable output. when I copied VT to SRAM the application was not stable.

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ **UART TX Issue in Minicom (Hardware Flow Control)**
**Problem:** Minicom wasn‚Äôt transmitting data because **hardware flow control (CTS/RTS) was enabled**.

‚úÖ **Solution:** Disabling hardware flow control in Minicom resolved the issue, allowing TX (sending commands from keyboard of PC) to work correctly.

### 3Ô∏è‚É£ **Function Pointer Struct Must Be Identical in Bootloader & Firmware**
**Problem:** A **struct holding function pointers that point to commonly used functions accross all the firmwares** was stored in a shared memory region, but modifying the struct (e.g., changing order, adding/removing members) in the respective firmwares led to unpredictable function calls.

‚úÖ **Solution:** The struct definition must be **identical in both Bootloader and Firmware**.
